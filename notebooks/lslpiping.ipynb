      "\n",
      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    The lab streaming layer provides a set of functions to make instrument data\n",
      "    accessible in real time within a lab network. From there, streams can be\n",
      "    picked up by recording programs, viewing programs or custom experiment\n",
      "    applications that access data streams in real time.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The API covers two areas:\n",
      "    - The \"push API\" allows to create stream outlets and to push data (regular\n",
      "      or irregular measurement time series, event data, coded audio/video frames,\n",
      "      etc.) into them.\n",
      "    - The \"pull API\" allows to create stream inlets and read time-synched\n",
      "      experiment data from them (for recording, viewing or experiment control).\n",
      "    \n",
      "    pylsl has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.4.\n",
